1. create variables humanScore and computerScore

/*Logic to play a single round. Function that takes the choices as arguments, plays an increments the round winner score and logs a winner announcement. 
    1. Create the sintax of function playRound.
    2. Define humanChoice and computerChoice as arguments.
    3. Make humanChoice parameter case-sensitive in this case transform to lower case always.
    4. Write the code for playground to console.log a string value representing the round winner ex. "You lose! Paper beats Rock"
    5. Increment the humanScore/computerScore based on the round winner.

 Playground function
    1. write the sintax with arguments humanChoice,computerChoice
    2. compare the inputs. first validate if the answer is the same. 
    3 if humanChoice = rock and computer choice = scissors then human wins 
    4. return a string wth the result.
    5. humanScore + 1 
    6. steps 3 to 5 for each of the possible combinations rock-paper, rock-scissor, paper-scissor. for one of them only because if 1 loses the other wins.

playGame
    1. Create a vble numGames that counts the times the function has been called
    2. Validate if numGames is <=5 to continue calling playRound or if >5 to finish the game
    3. if numGames is <5 we need to validate which value is higher if the human or computer score
